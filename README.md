# Projects of Frontend Practice

I recreate some real website pages picked by [Frontend Practice](https://frontendpractice.com/).

## Ableton

### To-Dos

- [x] Footer;
- [ ] Sticky subheader fade out as scrolling;
- [ ] Responsive for different screen sizes;
- [ ] CSS Grid usage check (LearnWithJason video, scrimba course);
- [x] The video section;
- [ ] The "More" dropdown on header;

## Backstage Talks

### To-Dos

- [x] Change background color while scrolling with snapping;
- [x] Hide scrollbar across all browsers;

‚ùó **NOTES**: Used the React version of [fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/) to make the scroll-snapping and no scrollbar work.
